# Second R Training

The second R Training will be on 20.10.2016, 17.30 at Aqualino @ Eawag. Please bring yourself, your laptop but also snacks and drinks, as the training will last for about three hours.

### Preparation

In preparation of the second training, please do the following:

1. Open the script that you have written during the first training.
2. Using your script, review the exercises from the first training, repeat them and save a “commented” and “clean” script for future use.
3. Open the remaining slides that we did not cover during the first training. 
4. Perform the exercises from those slides using your script.

### For the motivated

In case you feel motivated to do some more practise, download the upop.csv file from here: https://github.com/Larnsce/R-Training

This dataset shows you urban population in % of total population for 265  countries and regions between 1960 and 2015. The original dataset can be accessed here: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators

1. Start a new empty script in RStudio.
2. Enter the first three steps into your script using the upop.csv dataset.
3. Explore the dataset by using the functions that we practised during the first training.  
4. The total population of Uganda in 2002 was 24,227,297. Calculate the total urban population of Uganda in 2002.

Most importantly: Do not get too frustrated if number 4 does not work immediately. It will take some time and effort to easily master these tasks.
